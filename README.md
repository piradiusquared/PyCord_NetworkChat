# PyCord - Chat between clients
- Text app through Python socket programming

### Currently under development

#### Version Pre-v0.02
> Initialise basic server and client python files
> Re-wrote code to have basic modularity for easier maintenance  
> Serverside:
> - Accept user input for port.
> - Error checking when attempting to setup network related functions.
> - Range checking of port to prevent errors.

> Clientside:
> - Allow user to specify port to connect.
> - Pseudo "cat" functionality. Client sends a message, server sends back what is received.

- Note: Client/Server only allow for private IPs. Public hosts will be implemented with port forwarding or use public IP servers in the future
